# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
Python Handwritten Text Recognition for single Farsi letters.

the images used are farsi single letters in different size and fonts and styles. I can not share the main images but file out.csv is the result of readAllFileInFolder function and there is no need to use main images at all;)

TODO:explain question and code.
